The objective of this project is create a prototype of “T.A.B.” for real-world use.
“T.A.B.” can be used in bars, parties, and other social event to bring a unique
atmosphere to the environment. The goal is to reduce the time to make a drink,
eliminate human labor, and make “T.A.B.” at a low cost. Upon request, “T.A.B.” will
serve the user an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of their choosing. The user will
input which drink they desire and place a glass on the glass track, and the “T.A.B.” will
fill up the glass with the appropriate beverage. Which the user may pick up and enjoy.
